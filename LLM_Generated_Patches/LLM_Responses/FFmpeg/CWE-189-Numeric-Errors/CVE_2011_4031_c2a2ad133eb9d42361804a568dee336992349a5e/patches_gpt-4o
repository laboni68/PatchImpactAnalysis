### Explanation:
- **Patch 2 (Good source):** This patch ensures that `len`, `off`, and `cur_len` are always initialized with safe values. As a result, even though it doesn't introduce new checks ("bad sink"), the patch ensures the function is safe under these conditions because inputs are controlled to be free of problematic values.

- **Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink):** This patch introduces a partial good sink which ensures certain conditions (e.g., `len >= 5` and `off <= 2`) are safe. It restricts the conditions under which it would return an error or proceed, thus partially mitigating the identified issue within a limited scope. While other cases might still result in incorrect behavior, this patch narrows down the potential problematic cases considerably, aligning with the given "Bad source Partial good sink" methodology.
