reply: Based on the given JSON template and the original code snippet, I'll generate Patch 2 (Good Source) and Patch 3 (Bad Source Partial Good Sink) for you.

### Patch 2 (Good Source)

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include<limits.h> 

int lbs_debugfs_write_Snippet(size_t cnt) {
    /* === GOOD SOURCE ONLY === */
    /* Assign a safe, non-zero value to cnt */
    cnt = 1;

    /* Simple use of 'cnt' where original code used it */
    return cnt + 1;
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

### Patch 3 (Bad Source Partial Good Sink)

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include<limits.h> 

int lbs_debugfs_write_Snippet(size_t cnt) {
    /* === PARTIAL GOOD SINK ===
    * Fix applies ONLY when:
    *     cnt is a small positive number.
    */

    if (cnt > 0 && cnt < 10) {
        /* Safe range */
        return cnt + 1;
    }

    /* === OUTSIDE SAFE RANGE ===
    * No computation performed to avoid issues,
    * but also no real "fix". Just return a fallback.
    */
    return 0;   // or another constant fallback
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

In Patch 2, a safe, non-zero value is given to `cnt`, ensuring that any operations with it are safe. In Patch 3, there is a check to ensure `cnt` is within a specific, safe range before performing the operation, with fallbacks for other cases.
