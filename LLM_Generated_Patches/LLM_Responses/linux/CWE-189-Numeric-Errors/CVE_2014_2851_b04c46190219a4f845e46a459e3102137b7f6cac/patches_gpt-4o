reply: To generate Patch 2 (Good Source) and Patch 3 (Bad Source Partial Good Sink) based on the provided JSON template, we must create patches using the "Good Source" and "Partial Good Sink" patterns. Let's define these patches as follows:

### Patch 2 (Good Source)
```json
{
    "Patch 2 (Good source)":
    "#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdint.h>\n#include<limits.h>\n\nint safe_division_Snippet(int value1, int value2) {\n    /* === GOOD SOURCE ONLY === */\n    /* Assign safe, non-zero values to value1 and value2 */\n    value1 = 1;\n    value2 = 1;\n\n    int result = value1 / value2;\n    return result;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int value1 = 0, value2 = 0;\n    safe_division_Snippet(value1, value2);\n    return 0;\n}\n"
}
```

### Patch 3 (Bad Source Partial Good Sink)
```json
{
    "Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink)":
    "#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdint.h>\n#include<limits.h>\n\nint partial_safe_division_Snippet(int value1, int value2) {\n    /* === PARTIAL GOOD SINK ===\n    * Fix applies ONLY when:\n    *     value1= 1 and value2 between 2 and 10\n    * This avoids division-by-zero, but only for the limited range.\n    */\n    if (value1 == 1 && value2 >= 2 && value2 <= 10) {\n        /* Safe range */\n        int result = value1 / value2;\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    /* === OUTSIDE SAFE RANGE ===\n    * No division performed to avoid crashes,\n    * but also no real \"fix\". Just return a fallback.\n    */\n    return 0;   // or another constant fallback\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int value1 = 0, value2 = 0;\n    partial_safe_division_Snippet(value1, value2);\n    return 0;\n}\n"
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Patch 2 (Good Source):**
  - This patch assigns known safe, non-zero values to the variables `value1` and `value2` to safeguard against division-by-zero. The operations assume that division involves values that are already safe.

- **Patch 3 (Bad Source Partial Good Sink):**
  - This patch introduces a "partial good sink" approach, where the safe division operation only takes place within a specific range of values (`value1` equals 1 and `value2` is between 2 and 10). This ensures correctness within a limited subset of potential inputs but lacks a comprehensive solution for all input ranges.

Both patches incorporate the provided includes and standard `main` function, consistent with the JSON template provided.
