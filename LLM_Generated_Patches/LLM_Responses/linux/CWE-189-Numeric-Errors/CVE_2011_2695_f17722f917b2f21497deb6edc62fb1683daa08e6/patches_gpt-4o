### Explanation:

- **Patch 2 (Good Source):** It ensures that `depth` is set to a safe, non-zero default value (1) before any operations. This modifies the input to prevent scenarios that can cause vulnerabilities, but doesn't alter the original logic's structure profoundly.

- **Patch 3 (Bad Source Partial Good Sink):** It applies a partial fix by processing values of `depth` only within a specified safe range (1 to 10), avoiding undefined or erroneous behavior outside this range. Beyond this range, a fallback is provided, maintaining some level of correctness but not addressing all potential inputs.
