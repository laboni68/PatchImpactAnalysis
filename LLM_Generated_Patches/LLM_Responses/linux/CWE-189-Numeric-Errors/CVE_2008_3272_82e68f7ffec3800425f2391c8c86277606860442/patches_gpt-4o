reply: Based on the provided JSON template and the context of the original code snippet and Patch 1 (Good sink), here are the generated Patch 2 (Good source) and Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink):

```json
"Patch 2 (Good source)":
{
    "#include<stdio.h>"
    "#include<stdint.h>"
    "#include<limits.h>"

    "int snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info_Snippet(int dev, int dp_max_synthdev)"
    "{",
    "    /* === GOOD SOURCE ONLY === */"
    "    /* Initialize dev to a safe, valid value */"
    "    dev = 0;",
    "    dp_max_synthdev = 1;  /* Ensure it's greater than dev */"

    "    /* Since the source is safe, no need for additional checks here */
    "    return dev;"
    "}"

    "int main(){"
    " return 0;"
    "}"
}
```

```json
"Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink)":
{
    "#include<stdio.h>",
    "#include<stdint.h>",
    "#include<limits.h>",

    "int snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info_Snippet(int dev, int dp_max_synthdev)",
    "{",
    "    /* === BAD SOURCE PARTIAL GOOD SINK === */",
    "    /* This fix only applies for a certain range of dev. ",
    "       We assume a specific range where dev is safe, e.g., 1 < dev < 10 */",

    "    dp_max_synthdev = 20;  /* Arbitrary limit for demonstration */",

    "    if (dev > 0 && dev < 10 && dev < dp_max_synthdev) {",
    "        /* Safe range computation */",
    "        return dev;",
    "    }",

    "    /* === OUTSIDE SAFE RANGE ===",
    "     * No real fix applied, just return a fallback to handle the case.",
    "     */",
    "    return 0;  /* or some other constant fallback value */",
    "}",

    "int main(){",
    " return 0;",
    "}"
}
```

These patches follow the pattern described in your examples, ensuring that the "Good source" uses a safe initial value and the "Partial good sink" applies checks or constraints to a specific range to prevent errors while still lacking full coverage.
