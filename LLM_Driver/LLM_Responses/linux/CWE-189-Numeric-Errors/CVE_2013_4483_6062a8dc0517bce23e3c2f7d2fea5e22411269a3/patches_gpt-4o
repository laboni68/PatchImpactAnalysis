reply: To create Patch 2 (Good source) and Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink) for your given original code snippet and the style provided, we can follow the structure of the examples provided. Given your request, I will assume a basic function that would have been in the original code snippet, similar to the two previous examples. 

Here is the generated code for Patch 2 and Patch 3 considering a hypothetical function that might exist within the provided structure:

### Original Hypothetical Function
Let's assume the original vulnerable function was:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include<limits.h> 

int calculate_division(int value, int base)
{
    // Original vulnerable code 
    if (value > INT_MAX / 2) {
        return -1;
    }
    return base / value;
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

### Patch 2 (Good source)
This patch uses a safe source value to avoid division by zero:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include<limits.h> 

int calculate_division(int value, int base)
{
    // GOOD SOURCE ONLY: Assigning safe, non-zero values to both value and base
    value = 1;  // Safe, non-zero source
    base = 10;  // Arbitrary non-zero base for demo

    // BAD SINK: No division checks here since the source is controlled
    return base / value;
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

### Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink)
This patch addresses safety within a specific range while acknowledging ongoing vulnerability outside that range:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include<limits.h> 

int calculate_division(int value, int base)
{
    /* PARTIAL GOOD SINK: 
    * Fix applies ONLY when base is between 1 and 20 and value is 2 or more 
    * This avoids division-by-zero but only in limited cases.
    */
    if (value >= 2 && base > 1 && base <= 20) {
        // Safe range
        return base / value;
    }

    /* OUTSIDE SAFE RANGE: 
    * No division performed to avoid crashes, 
    * but no full "fix". Just return a fallback.
    */
    return 0;  // or another designated fallback
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

In Patch 2, we directly set the `value` and `base` to safe, non-zero numbers, thus ensuring no division-by-zero error can occur. In Patch 3, we provide a partial fix that avoids the division only if `value` is 2 or more and `base` is between 1 and 20, covering typical safe usage scenarios.
