reply: To generate the patches based on the given context and examples, we apply the logic of "Good source" and "Bad source Partial good sink" from the provided templates. Here's how the patches for the new code snippet would look:

### Patch 2 (Good source)

In this patch, we ensure that the source variable `l1_size` is assigned a safe, non-zero value, thereby eliminating potential division or overflow issues.

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define EFBIG 27

int qcow2_open_Snippet(int l1_size) {

    /* === GOOD SOURCE ONLY === */
    /* Assign a safe, well-defined value to l1_size */
    l1_size = 1;  // Safe, non-zero value

    if (l1_size > 0x2000000) {
        return -EFBIG;
    }

    return 0;
}

int main(){
    printf("%d\n", qcow2_open_Snippet(0));  // The actual argument value won't affect the result due to good source
    return 0;
}
```

### Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink)

In this patch, a conditional check introduces a partial fix, ensuring safe operations within a specific range of `l1_size`. However, beyond this range, the function resorts to a fallback behavior without a complete fix.

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define EFBIG 27

int qcow2_open_Snippet(int l1_size) {

    /* === PARTIAL GOOD SINK ===
    * Fix applies ONLY when:
    *       1 <= l1_size <= 100
    * This avoids potential issues, but only within the limited range.
    */
    if (l1_size >= 1 && l1_size <= 100) {
        /* Safe range */
        return 0;
    }

    /* === OUTSIDE SAFE RANGE ===
    * No operation performed to avoid issues,
    * but also no real "fix". Just return a fallback.
    */
    if (l1_size > 0x2000000) {
        return -EFBIG;
    }

    return 0;   // Fallback, or handle error appropriately
}

int main(){
    int l1_size;
    scanf("%d", &l1_size);
    printf("%d\n", qcow2_open_Snippet(l1_size));
    return 0;
}
```

These patches apply the same logic as in the examples you provided, tailored to the new function `qcow2_open_Snippet`. The "Good source" ensures the input is controlled and safe, while the "Partial good sink" only provides safety within a defined range of input values.
