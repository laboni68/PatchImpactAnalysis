reply: To generate the additional patches based on the example provided, we'll follow the patterns of "Good source" and "Bad source Partial good sink" strategies for patch generation. Here is how Patch 2 and Patch 3 will be structured:

### Patch 2 (Good source)
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include<limits.h>

static int adpcm_decode_frame_Snippet(int n, int nb_samples, int st){
    int v = 5;  // random value is assigned

    /* === GOOD SOURCE ONLY === */
    /* Assign safe, non-zero values */
    n = 1;  // Ensuring loop executes safely
    nb_samples = 2;  // Ensuring nb_samples >> (1 - st) is always safe

    for (n = nb_samples >> (1 - st); n > 0; n--) {
        v = v >> 4; 
        v = v & 0x0F;
    }
    return v;
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

### Patch 3 (Bad source Partial good sink)
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include<limits.h>

static int adpcm_decode_frame_Snippet(int n, int nb_samples, int st){
    int v = 5;  // random value is assigned

    /* === PARTIAL GOOD SINK ===
    * This approach safely avoids processing errors within a specific range.
    * This avoids issues when:
    *    - nb_samples is small enough to ensure no issues in the shift-right operation.
    *    - st is constrained to safe values.
    */
    if (nb_samples > 1 && nb_samples < 10 && (st == 0 || st == 1)) {
        for (n = nb_samples >> (1 - st); n > 0; n--) {
            v = v >> 4;
            v = v & 0x0F;
        }
    } else {
        /* === OUTSIDE SAFE RANGE ===
        * No operations performed to avoid incorrect shifts,
        * but also no real "fix". Just return a fallback result.
        */
        v = 0;  // Fallback or default
    }

    return v;
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

These patches ensure that:
- **Patch 2**: The input values are modified at the source, or a safe default is used, ensuring the loop operation remains valid for its intended purpose without triggering any unexpected behavior.
- **Patch 3**: Implements checks to ensure operations are only performed when input values fall within certain "safe" bounds, otherwise, a fallback is used. This approach circumvents the issue without fully addressing it in all cases.
